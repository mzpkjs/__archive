# JavaScript Training

## Motivation
After a hiring a new joiner it's not that easy to provide them a client  
as they're often not up to speed with their issued tasks; they often tend to take a more passive approach rather than a proactive one;  
they shy from ceremonies where client attends like sprint review/demo, consequently reducing their visibility & value from a client's perspective;  

Providing them with a prior training on a dummy project should solve those issues & give us more time to find them a proper project without idling.



## Goals
- Raise the knowledge & skill level of participants
- Guide participants on how to increase their value & visibility when working for a client
- Shift the mindset of participants from a "me as an individual" to "us as a team" and from a "push" to a "pull" ticketing system
- Give us an information about their strengths & weaknesses, so we can match a project that would be for them a better fit
- Provide them with a constructive feedback & guidelines, so they can grow on their own at accelerated speed



## Assumptions
- Participants contribute to the codebase through PR's which has to be reviewed
    - On Sprint 1, each PR has to be accepted by a single mentor
    - On Sprint 2, each PR has to be accepted by a single person in a team, and a mentor
    - On Sprint 3, each PR has to be accepted by single person in a team, mentors can only provide feedback in comments
